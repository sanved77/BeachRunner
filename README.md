## An endless runner game

An endless runner game on a sunny beach. 
- I have used Unity to develop this project. 
- The code auto generates the path and deletes the previous path. 
- The runner is pushed forward using a physics force field. 
- The 3D rigs and animation are taken from Mixamo.com. 
- The camera tracks and follows the player while keeping the animation smooth.
- The score is based on how long the player can keep going
- The game ends when you collide on any object.
